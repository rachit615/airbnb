This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

page.tsx is a server component , but we are fetching listings in server component.
`app/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/` URL
Pages are Server Components by default but can be set to a Client Component.

Layouts

Layouts in a route are nested by default. Each parent layout wraps child layouts below it using the React children prop.
A layout.js and page.js file can be defined in the same folder. The layout will wrap the page.

A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render.

we CAN'T use HOOKS inside SERVER COMPONENTS.
